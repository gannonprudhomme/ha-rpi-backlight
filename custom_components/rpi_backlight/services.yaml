  # device, or area. If `target` is specified, `entity_id` should not be defined in the `fields`
  # map. By default it shows only targets matching entities from the same domain as the service,
  # but if further customization is required, target supports the entity, device, and area selectors

  # automatically be applied to device and area, and device selector parameters will automatically be applied to area. ^
